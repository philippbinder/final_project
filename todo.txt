Bugs
  + fix bugs in register.tsx and login.tsx DONE (needed thorough postgres restart)
  + fix bug in register.ts

Registration and Database
  - JSON error message if I enter a username on the registration page that I have allready exists and try create it as a new user
  - such failed usernames still take up one ID number despite not existing => ID 2-4 wont show up again in the dt
  + hide acutal password with ******* DONE
  - switch "Show Password" to "Hide Password" based on the state of showPassword
  - add a message after successful registration "Registration successful"
  - add password constraint: Lack sufficient entropy: aaaaaaaaa
  - add password constraint: Match common dictionary words: anteaters1

  + make the go back button really go back - worked around by taking the user back to the landing page
  - create a dropdown menu contacts with links to mylinkedin and upleveled profile
  - make sure that the 1 hour expiry timestamp is working
  + IMPORTANT user shouldn't be able to access village side or any other relating to village if he is not logged in / has no session token
  + what if user logs in, types in url for login and logs in a second time? 2 users logged in at the same time? ONLY happens with router.push, not with middelware, which prevents that but by redirecting to one single page all the time -> user can only access one page once logged in
    -> SOLUTION: redirect if user is logged in and make village only accesible if user is logged in
  - check if sessiontoken exists on the dialogue pages etc to kick user if he is not logged in

Save Game / database
  - game needs to keep track of which villagers the player has already talked to and to which he hasn't -> automatically saves any progress in database? If I do it that way, a save game button wouldn't make any sense because everything gets saved immideatly


Presentation of Log in and Registration
  + make the register page look like the registrarionPage page DONE EVEN BETTER
  - use components for the background layout
  + move away from the brown color theme to a more dark one fitting with the red glow effect?
  - make the buttons at index.tsx shift inwards if hovered over / or clicked? For satisfying 3D click effect

Village / Game screen
  - add a logout button? Or should it only appear once the user clicks on the exit game button, ergo on the index.js file?
  - add a "About this game" button or something like that that explains the gameplay and maybe the project in general

Cookies
  + cookies for the session?

CRF Token ?

Images
  - download, store and upload images
  - credit artists

Deployment
  - Preflight and all that lovely stuff
  - these test runs that are demanded
  - deployment on Heroku

UpLeveled Todo'showPassword
  - create and set own favicon

Read up on
  - await sql <User[]> / await sql<[User]>
    => const [user] = await sql <[User]>

Karl:
--- indicate to the user that one villager has alrdy been talked to
--- keep track of the score
--- delay last answer so user can read the asnwer an is not immideatly pushed to the ending screen- like after going back to the village screen
    => when I load the village screen runServerSideProps - check for win or lose condition


Function for changing null in db status correct to true or false with api
buttons dont work as buttons anymore with component
whats left of buttons center their text, looks stupid
Then redirect to answer succeed or fail
button or link to go back
