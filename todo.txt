  - such failed usernames still take up one ID number despite not existing => ID 2-4 wont show up again in the dt
      need to test if this old error still exists
  - switch "Show Password" to "Hide Password" based on the state of showPassword
  - add a message after successful registration "Registration successful"
  - add password constraint: Lack sufficient entropy: aaaaaaaaa
  - add password constraint: Match common dictionary words: anteaters1

Presentation of Log in and Registration
  ~ use components for the background layout
  + move away from the brown color theme to a more dark one fitting with the red glow effect?
  - make the buttons at index.tsx shift inwards if hovered over / or clicked? For satisfying 3D click effect


Stability
  - these test runs that are demanded

Read up on
  - await sql <User[]> / await sql<[User]>
    => const [user] = await sql <[User]>

Functionality:

--- delay last answer so user can read the answer an is not immideatly pushed to the ending screen- like after going back to the village screen
- a clear function so that the user can play multiple rounds with the same account
